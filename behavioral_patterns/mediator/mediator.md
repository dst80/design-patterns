## Mediator Pattern

Define an object that encapsulate how a set of objects interact. Mediator promotes loose coupling by keeping objects from referring to each other explicitly, and it lets you vary therir interaction independently.

```plantuml
@startuml mediator
skinparam ranksep 50
skinparam nodesep 50
skinparam class {
  FontSize 13
  AttributeFontSize 13
  FontStyle bold
  BackgroundColor transparent
  BorderColor black
}
skinparam arrow {
  Color black
  FontColor black
  Thickness 2
}
skinparam note {
  BackgroundColor transparent
  BorderColor black
}

together {
    interface Mediator {
        OnChanged(Colleague)
    }

    class ConcreteMediator extends Mediator {
        OnChanged(Colleague)
    }

    note left of ConcreteMediator::OnChanged
        concreteColleague1.GetSomething()
        ...
        concreteColleague2.SetSomething()
    end note
}

together {
    interface Colleague {
        Changed()
    }

    class ConcreteColleague1 extends Colleague {
        GetSomething()
        Changed()
    }
    class ConcreteColleague2 extends Colleague {
        SetSomething()
        Changed()
    }
}

Mediator::OnChanged <- Colleague::Changed 
ConcreteMediator::OnChanged -> ConcreteColleague1::GetSomething
ConcreteMediator::OnChanged -> ConcreteColleague2::SetSomething

Used nomenclature for Mediator Pattern is:

* ***Mediator***
  * defines the interface for communicating with Colleague classes
* ***ConcreteMediator***
  * implements cooperative behavior by coordinating Colleague objects.
  * knows and maintains its colleagues.
* ***Colleague***
  * each Colleague class knows its Mediator object
  * each colleague communicates with its mediator whenever it would have otherwise communicated with other colleague.

### Usage

Use the Mediator pattern when

* a set objects communicate in well-defines but complex ways. The resulting interdependencies are unstructured and difficult to unterstand.

* reusing an object is difficult because it refers to and communicates with many other objects

* a behavior that`s distributed between several classes should be customizable without a lot of subclassing.

#### Advantages

* It limits subclassing, because the mediator localize behavior that otherwise would be distributed among several objects
* It decouple colleague objects, because they donËšt have to know other colleague which depend on there changes
* It simplifies the object protocol interactions from a many to many communication to a single to many communication.
* Centerlize the control of interactions between different colleagues.

#### Disadvantages

* Due to its centerlized roll, the mediator could grow to a god like interaction class.
